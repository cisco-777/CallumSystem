Context: I'm working on a cannabis dispensary management system where user registration works in development but COMPLETELY FAILS to save users to the database on the deployed website. This is a CRITICAL production bug that must be fixed immediately or the client will unsubscribe.

Specific Task: DIAGNOSE AND FIX the exact reason why user registration fails to save to the database in production deployment. Stop adding useless validation code and fix the ROOT CAUSE.

Requirements:
THE PROBLEM: Users can register on deployed website but are NEVER saved to database - they disappear completely
THE REQUIREMENT: Make user registration actually work on deployed website so users get saved to database

MANDATORY FIXES TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE:
- Check if DATABASE_URL environment variable is different between development and production
- Verify production database has write permissions for user table
- Fix any async/await timing issues where response is sent before database write completes  
- Check if database transactions are being rolled back due to hidden errors
- Verify production database schema matches development schema exactly
- Fix any connection pool or SSL issues specific to production deployment
- Ensure database INSERT actually executes and commits in production environment

DO NOT ADD MORE LOGGING OR VALIDATION - FIX THE ACTUAL DATABASE SAVING MECHANISM

If this command does not result in users being successfully saved to the database on the deployed website, the fix is incomplete and unacceptable.

DATABASE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Do not modify, drop, or recreate any existing database tables or schema
- Only ADD new tables/columns without affecting existing data
- Preserve all current data including products, orders, users, and analytics
- Use database migrations that are additive only - never destructive
- Test all database changes in development mode first

Constraints: FIX THE PRODUCTION USER REGISTRATION DATABASE SAVING. No more debugging code. Solve the actual problem or the client cancels subscription.
