FINAL COMMAND FOR REPLIT AGENT:
	1.	Make the website fully scrollable:
Remove tab-based navigation. Replace it with anchor-linked sections in a single-page scroll layout. All navigation buttons (Home, Products, Member Area, Events, Order) must scroll to the matching section on the same page, not load a new one.
	2.	Replace the “Events” section with a full scroll section called “Upcoming Events” including the following 3 real cards:

	•	Event 1:
	•	Title: “Welcome Night - July 10th”
	•	Description: “Meet other members and enjoy exclusive samples.”
	•	Image: Use a generic club/lounge interior photo.
	•	No buttons.
	•	Event 2:
	•	Title: “420 Celebration - August 20th”
	•	Description: “Live music, free gifts, and club updates.”
	•	Image: Use a generic festive image (not weed-themed).
	•	No buttons.
	•	Event 3:
	•	Title: “Autumn Tasting - September 15th”
	•	Description: “Explore our latest strains with guided tastings.”
	•	Image: Use a cozy cafe or indoor tasting image.
	•	No buttons.

	3.	In the Member Area section, add a fully visible “🎂 Birthday Gift Tracker” section with mock data:

	•	Heading: “🎂 Birthday Gift Tracker”

	•	Add the following list:
	•	Sofia – July 2 – Gift Ready
	•	Matteo – August 9 – Gift Pending
	•	Jamal – September 12 – Gift Ready

No chatbot used. All content must be native to the site.
	4.	Add stock images throughout the site (must be visually visible on screen):

	•	Homepage hero section: use stock image of a classy lounge or indoor club space.

	•	Member Area: image of smiling members inside a stylish club.
	•	Events section: use images as described in the event cards above.
