Requirements:

Place QR code image at the top of the member catalogue page
Use a stock QR code image for now (placeholder for future unique codes)
Position it prominently but not interfering with existing layout
Add appropriate styling to make it look professional
Ensure John Doe (demo account) also displays the QR code on his catalogue
Make it responsive for both mobile and desktop views
Add a small label like "Member QR Code" or "Your QR Code" above or below the image
Constraints: Only add the QR code display to the member catalogue - do not modify admin dashboard or other functionality. Use placeholder/stock QR code image for now.

Replit Agent Command - Add QR Scanner & Update Completion Message
Command: Add QR Scanner Button and Update Order Completion Flow
Context: I need to add QR scanning functionality for staff and update the user experience when completing orders.
Specific Task: Add a QR scanner button to admin dashboard and change the order completion message for users.
Requirements:
Part 1: Add QR Scanner Button to Admin Dashboard

Add a prominent "Scan QR Code" button to the admin dashboard
Position it in a logical location (near other admin tools/actions)
Style it to match existing admin dashboard buttons
Make it clearly visible and accessible for staff
Button should be non-functional for now (no logic behind it)
Add appropriate icon (camera or QR code icon if available)

Part 2: Update Order Completion Message

Find where users currently receive the 4-digit code message after clicking "complete donation"
Replace the current message with new text that directs them to the counter
New message should say something like: "Order completed! Please proceed to the counter and show your QR code to our staff member for collection."
Make the message clear, professional, and user-friendly
Ensure the message fits well within the existing UI design

Constraints: Only add the button and update the message - no backend functionality needed for the scanner yet.
